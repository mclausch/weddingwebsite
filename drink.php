			<h3 class="heading-<?php echo $gPageColor; ?>"><strong>Cocktails &amp; Distilleries</strong></h3>
			<p>And to round things off here are our favourite cocktail bars in the city. Trick Dog, hands down, is the most fun to go to. It is always packed, super loud, and has a unique hand crafted menu that they change quarterly. We recommend you go to the back and up the stairs where you can ask to be seated for a meal or just drinks in the loft. It is wonderful. Oh, and try their kale salad!</p>
