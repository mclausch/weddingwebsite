			<p>For all of you that know us well, you know that we LOVE food. A LOT. So we have of course compiled a list of some of our favorite places to eat in San Francisco. It is an amazing city to live in for Foodies, as SF officially de-throned New York in 2018 as the US city with the most three-Michelin-starred restaurants. SF is a great place to explore varieties of food like Italian, Mexican, Modern American, Japanese, Burmese, Chinese, and so much more. It is a competitive and ever changing landscape of new places to try and amazing food to explore: from a hole in the wall taco place to an extravagant multi-course meal ranging in the hundreds of dollars per person. A big part of the secret to SF's amazing restaurants is the access to all of the bounty of California's enormous agricultural industry. The fresh, local fruits and vegetables are fantastic and it really shows in the final dishes. Explore the many farmer's markets to get the produce straight from the source yourself.</p>
			<p>Drinks, including beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, kombucha, and more are also very excellent in the Bay Area. In fact there's so much to cover there that we've made a separate page for <a class="body-link" href="drink.php">the liquid pleasures</a>.</p>
			<p>Our big (and incomplete) list below hits food from all over the world and runs the spectrum from ridiculously cheap to insanely expensive. Hopefully there is something for everyone. However, if you'd like to strike out on your own then we recommend two primary websites for research:</p>

			<p>For those with dietary restrictions, San Francisco has you covered. Vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, nut-free, dairy-free, paleo, kosher, allergies, etc. Pretty much everything is handled and you can expect servers to ask if you need accomodations.</p>

			<p>The best restaurants in San Francisco are often very busy. For those that take reservations, it's a good idea to book a week in advance or more. For those that don't, be prepared to get in line. San Franciscans love nothing more than standing in line for food.</p>

			<p>Without further ado, here is our big list (in no particular order)! You can also view all of these places and more on our annotated <a class="body-link" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Wsad_ctX5PhXNhI0BLrNKqU8f5Q&amp;usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Map</a>.</p>
