			<p>This page provides tips and information about life in the San Francisco Bay Area to help you make the most of your time here. Although much of this page is applicable for people from anywhere, it is targeted at those coming from outside of the US, particularly all the friendly Canadians who'll be joining us.</p>

			<h3 class="heading-<?php echo $gPageColor; ?>"><strong>Getting Around</strong></h3>
			<h4 class="heading-<?php echo $gPageColor; ?>">Self-Propelled</h4>
			<p>Despite its hills, San Francisco is a very walkable city, at only seven square miles in size. We feel that anywhere you go in the world, walking is the best way to learn more about that spot. Biking is another very popular self-propelled way of seeing the city. If you choose to rent a bike, we recommend <a class="body-link" href="http://bikegoldengatebridge.com/" target="_blank">Basically Free Bike Rentals</a>.</p>
			<h4 class="heading-<?php echo $gPageColor; ?>">Taxi</h4>
			<p>Like any large city, there are several traditional taxi companies if that is how you'd like to get around. Your hotel can help you arrange such service or you can do it yourself by phone, online, or by a mobile app. The largest taxi company in San Francisco is <a class="body-link" href="http://flywheeltaxi.com/">Desoto Cabs</a> and can be reached at 415-970-1300. Desoto also runs the "Flywheel" mobile application, a competitor to Uber/Lyft that lets you order from your phone and track your driver. Another popular taxi company is <a class="body-link" href="http://yellowcabsf.com/">Yellow Cab</a> (415-333-3333) and they also have a mobile app to aid in booking.</p>
			<h4 class="heading-<?php echo $gPageColor; ?>">Rideshare</h4>
			<p>Modern ridesharing was born in the San Francisco Bay Area and is used heavily all over the region. If you will have a smartphone with a data plan valid in the US this can be a cheaper (and often easier) option than a regular taxi.</p>
			<p>Our preferred rideshare program is <a class="body-link" href="http://lyft.com" target="_blank">Lyft</a> (available on <a class="body-link" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lyft-on-demand-ridesharing/id529379082?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a> or <a class="body-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.lyft.android" target="_blank">Android</a>). If you haven't used Lyft before you can sign up with our referral code, "SARAHMATTHEWWED" to get a $5 credit to your first ride (Lyft also gives us a credit after your first ride).</p>
			<p>A few tips for those that haven’t used a ridesharing service before. If you want a car all to yourself or are travelling with more than 2 people, request a regular Lyft. If your party is 1-2 people, you don’t mind sharing your ride with someone you don't know, and you aren’t in a hurry, we recommend requesting a Lyft Line which pairs your party up with other riders and is often cheaper than a regular Lyft. Uber has a similar system with UberX (car just for you and your party) and Uber Pool (shared ride).</p>
			<h4 class="heading-<?php echo $gPageColor; ?>">Tour Bus</h4>
			<p>Although they can be cheesy at times, "Hop-on-Hop-off" bus tours can be a great way to get around the city quickly and easily, hitting all the major sights. In San Francisco we recommend the <a class="body-link" href="https://www.bigbustours.com/en/san-francisco/san-francisco-bus-tours/" target="_blank">Big Bus Tours</a> which feature double-decker buses with open tops that you can ride around the city and across the Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
			<h4 class="heading-<?php echo $gPageColor; ?>">Public Transit</h4>
			<p> Within the city <a class="body-link" href="https://www.sfmta.com/" target="_blank">MUNI</a> runs city buses and light rail that provide surprisingly thorough coverage. Adult fares are $2.75 and allow unlimited transfers for 90 minutes. <a class="body-link" href="https://www.bart.gov/" target="_blank">BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit)</a>, provides transit connections between San Francisco, SFO Airport, and many cities in East Bay. <a class="body-link" href="http://www.caltrain.com/" target="_blank">Caltrain</a> provides transit connections between San Francisco and most cities on the Peninsula and South Bay. For transit options in Marin and North Bay check out <a class="body-link" href="http://goldengatetransit.org/" target="_blank">Golden Gate Transit</a>. BART, Caltrain, and Golden Gate Transit all have zone-based fares (i.e. you pay based on how far you travel). For something a little more exciting, check out <a class="body-link" href="http://sanfranciscobayferry.com/" target="_blank">San Francisco Bay Ferry</a> for transit options back and forth across the Bay.</p>
			<p><a class="body-link" href="https://www.clippercard.com" target="_blank">Clipper Cards</a> are refillable transit payment cards that can be used on any transit system in the San Francisco Bay Area (including MUNI, BART, Caltrain, Golden Gate Transit, and ferries). They can be purchased/reloaded at any major transit station or at any Walgreens pharmacy. If you plan on using transit more than once or twice we highly recommend you pick up a Clipper Card.</p>
			<p>Google Maps and Apple Maps are both very good at providing directions and routing for public transit within San Francisco. <a class="body-link" href="http://rocketmanapp.com/" target="_blank">RocketMan</a> is an excellent app for tracking bus arrival times in many major cities (including San Francisco and Toronto). Major stations also have paper maps to help you get around and many bus stops have full system maps posted in the shelters. Any San Francisco guide book should also have information about public transit. <a class="body-link" href="https://citymapper.com/" target="_blank">Citymapper</a> is also an excellent transit app, which consolidates all the major transit systems and transit maps in one spot.</p>
			<h4 class="heading-<?php echo $gPageColor; ?>">Car Rentals</h4>
			<p>Within the city limits having a car can be quite expensive due to the cost of parking. Traffic is also regularly quite heavy and the narrow, hilly streets can be intimidating to unfamiliar drivers. We recommend seeing the city in other ways.</p>
			<p>If you'd like to venture outside of the city to various state/national parks, wineries, or other sights then a car quickly becomes a necessity. Most major car rental companies have locations within the city limits so we recommend renting a car only for the days you need it, rather than getting a car at the airport and maintaining the rental for the duration of your trip.</p>
			<hr/>

			<h3 class="heading-<?php echo $gPageColor; ?>"><strong>Cell Phones</strong></h3>
			<p>Despite its reputation as a tech-hub, San Francisco can have surprisingly spotty cell phone reception. The hills seem to get in the way and the locals try to keep too many cell towers from popping up. Expect to occasionally find yourself waving your phone around trying to find service.</p>
			<p>For those coming in from Canada, check with your carrier to see about roaming options in the United States. If your cell phone is unlocked, we recommend getting a US SIM card from <a class="body-link" href="https://roammobility.com/" target="_blank">Roam Mobility</a>. You can get the SIM card before you leave Canada and they provide generous data and calling plans for relatively little money. When you arrive you simply pop the new SIM card into your phone and you're good to go with local service. Matthew's mom uses it all the time when she visits.</p>

			<h3 class="heading-<?php echo $gPageColor; ?>"><strong>Money</strong></h3>
			<p>This probably goes without saying but the currency in San Francisco is US Dollars. No vendor accepts any other form of currency. Get some US cash before you leave home, or grab some at the airport when you arrive.</p>
			<p>Major credit cards (Visa, AmEx, Mastercard) from any country are accepted almost everywhere, even at many vendors in farmer's markets. Note that "chip-and-pin" is still new in America and doesn't work the same as the rest of the world. In most places it's "chip-and-sign." Be careful of extra charges on your card for foreign transactions.</p>
			<p>You debit card should work in any major bank machine for withdrawing US cash. Although many vendors now take debit cards in America, foreign debit cards often do not at points-of-sale. Plan to pay with cash or credit card.</p>
			<hr/>

			<h3 class="heading-<?php echo $gPageColor; ?>"><strong>Climate</strong></h3>
			<p>San Francisco's climate is not what is popularly considered typical for California. It is rarely sunny and hot. In May the average high is 64F/18C and the average low is 49F/10C. It is often foggy and windy, making those temperatures feel much colder. Climate can also vary immensely within the city limits, with warm sun in the Mission and cold windy fog at Ocean Beach.</p>
			<p>Driving an hour in any direction from San Francisco often produces the warm, sunny, California climate visitors might expect. But keep in mind that wherever you go, evenings will often be chilly as California is a desert climate.</p>
			<hr/>

			<h3 class="heading-<?php echo $gPageColor; ?>"><strong>Dress</strong></h3>
			<p>San Francisco is a ridiculously casual city. Jeans and a hoodie qualify as "fancy dress" in most situations, and it's not strange to see people in shorts and a t-shirt at even the fanciest restaurants. Regardless of your personal style though, the key to being happy in San Francisco is to wear layers. The weather can change from neighbourhood-to-neighbourhood and hour-to-hour without much warning. It's classic to see shivering tourists rushing to buy over-priced hoodies to get warm. Don't be those people.</p>
			<hr/>

			<h3 class="heading-<?php echo $gPageColor; ?>"><strong>Safety</strong></h3>
			<p>San Francisco is a typical big, tourist-heavy city and thus comes with the associated criminal issues. Pick-pockets are common in tourist areas like the Ferry Building, Fisherman's Wharf, and Haight-Ashbury. Keep an eye on personal belongings at all time. If you get a car, be sure to never leave any personal belongings visible on the seats. "Smash-and-grab" attacks on parked cars are very common, especially near tourist areas.</p>
			<p>Muggings and other violent attacks are much less common than property crime, the city is relatively safe in that regard.</p>
			<p>San Francisco has a very large homeless population that is mostly harmless, but can be discomforting to people who are unprepared. Many suffer from addiction and mental health issues. It is best to avoid interaction, but if you'd like to help out then offers to buy them food or help them to get somewhere are best. Donations to local shelters and food banks can also be a very effective way to make a difference.</p>
			<p>Most of San Francisco is "safe" however there are a few neighbourhoods that can be a bit rough. The most well known in this regard is "The Tenderloin" located just west of Union Square, all around the Civic Center. There are many great restaurants and bars in the region, but there is also a large concentration of homelessness and drug use. Be aware of your surroundings when walking in the area after dark.</p>
			<p>Marijuana is now legal for recreational use in California and dispensaries are starting to pop up around the city. Keep in mind that the drug is not considered legal by the federal government and that continues to be a contentious issue. The Presidio is federal land and thus possession of marijuana within the boundaries is considered a federal crime. Federal drug offences can prevent you from re-entering the US for decades. Use at your own risk.</p>
