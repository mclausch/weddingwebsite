			<p>The city of San Francisco is a small square, 7 miles on a side, located at the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula, which divides the San Francisco Bay from the Pacific Ocean. The greater San Francisco region is known as the Bay Area and includes cities like Oakland, Berkeley, San Jose, San Rafael, Santa Rosa, Palo Alto, Mountain View, and many more. The Bay Area is home to Silicon Valley, the Napa and Sonoma wine regions, beautiful beaches, amazing national and state parks, countless museums and event spaces, hundreds of world-class restaurants, spectacular bridges, and an amazing variety of plant and animal life.</p>
			<p>The Bay Area is divided up into 5 major regions: the City of San Francisco (or just "The City"), East Bay, North Bay, the Peninsula, and South Bay. The City of San Francisco is divided up into a huge number of tiny, walkable neighbourhoods all with distinct and interesting features and characteristics. The hilly nature of the city produces what are known as "micro-climates" &mdash; the many different neighbourhoods all also experience greatly varying weather. Bring layers!</p>
			<p>The Bay Area is the gateway to Northern California and the Pacific Northwest, a vast area of enormous redwoods, temperate climates, and gorgeous national parks.</p>
